7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?

If there are restrictions or predetermined length of stay (ex. for a 60-day program), how will this impact your findings and conclusions? Can these data be suppplemented with other stats to support findings? 

An interactive tool could be helpful to explore these data at a client level.
