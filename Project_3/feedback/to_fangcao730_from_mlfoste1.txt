The two objectives sounds very similar in regards to the insight it provides to UMD.  I think more clarification on #2 would be helpful.


8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).

Don't forget to add!

The direction is clear.
