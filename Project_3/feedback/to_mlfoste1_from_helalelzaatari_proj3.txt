1) Yes the project is organized modularly with make as the workflow manager

2) Yes python is used exclusively for wrangling and includes the package pandas and 
R is used for visualization with tidyverse and ggplot used.

3)Yes there is a docker file and I think it works fine. I didn't run the code I just
looked at it looks fine.

4) Yes, the author was interested in the clients age, race ethnicity, veteran status
and disability type and a bunch of other things. THe plots used in R had various patterns
and relationships shown such as number of individual families and years of service.
plot.

5) In my opinion the project is very well organized as is. It was commented pretty well
and it is very structured. Maybe add some more empty lines between the comments and code
in the docker and makefiles.

6) Yes it was clear from the README what the author wanted to achieve.

7) This project takes into account many variables in which clients have. For example, 
their age or whether they are a veteran etc... It would help the client more if more detail
was included in the goal section of the README.

8) No, it should be included in the author's README. 

9) The figures are pretty self explanatory. However in my opinion, it would be useful
to add some interpretation comments in the R code after a plot was coded.

10) Yes in both the python and R code there was a comment signaling the author's purpose
and what they wanted to achieve with that code.

11) The take- home messages should be added in the updated README or commented in the R-code.
But the messages were clear if you ran the R code and saw the plots.
